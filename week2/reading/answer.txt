Question 1:
protocol: https
domain:catalog.drexel.edu
route:/undergraduate/collegeofcomputingandinformatics/computerscience/
not port

Question 2:
a: request method is GET. Get method will ask for information, just return the message, without change anything.
b: route requested : /foo/bar , bar file probably will be served.
c: It's mean user are send request from Firefox on Macbook
d: English.
e: No. because Get usually not change anything, so you don't need body.

Question 3:
a: 200, and 200 is mean successfully access the link. Everything is right.
b: text/plain, this is mean it's a pure text file, no html, or js or something like that, just a txt file, like table or list, just some text data.

Question 4:
This is because google.com is just a entry point, the big website usually will split into many components, this depends on the frame work, like VUE3. And also the website will have a lot of api or resource are also using http.

Question 5:
a:
From cmd:
StatusCode        : 200
StatusDescription : OK
Content           : <p>Hello! <strong>I am a paragraph!</strong></p>

RawContent        : HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                    Connection: keep-alive
                    Keep-Alive: timeout=5
                    Content-Length: 49

The infomation on website are little more than cmd.

b: HTTP reuest sent by curl will lack some information inside of header, something like cookie or accept-Language.

Question 6:
I think the reason is 127.0.0.1:3000/foo/bar/baaz is not exsit, so it return the defualt index.html page.

Question 7:
The content and style are changed. Now the page only have Hello! I am a paragraph! with correct style.
The reason we have this changes is because we change the content-type from plain to html. So the web will render like html.
